Repository for ISP - Predicting Future Baseball Hall-of-Famers, Past Snubs, and Outliers

I will analyze the statistics of all MLB players who have and hadnâ€™t been inducted 
into the Baseball Hall of Fame (HoF). Using advanced stats, I will set a baseline for the
statistics of all players inducted into the HOF and see if any have made it in with lower
than baseline statistics. I will then use this baseline to determine if any non-inductees
have been snubbed based purely on their statistics. Finally, I will determine which
players are on track to meet the baseline numbers and predict who may eventually be
inducted into the HoF when eligible. The data will not take into account those inducted
or not inducted due to off-field, non-statistical data.

I'm using data collected from Baseball-Reference / Stathead, based on filters for HoF 
status and minimum games played.
